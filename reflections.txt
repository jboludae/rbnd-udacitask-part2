# What you added to Udacitask 2.0
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. What is the gem of your choice and how did you use it?
I used terminal-table gem to format the table nicely.
2. Describe the 2 features you added to the project.
  a) I added the ability to delete several items at once. You can just
  enter several indexes in the .delete method and those items will be
  deleted.
  b) I added the ability to change the priority of the to-do items. I added
  the Udacilist.change_priority_item(index, new_priority_level) method.
  That method calls a ToDoItem.change_priority(new_priority) method that
  set the new priority (only if it is a valid priority level).

# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project? About 7-8 hours
2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
	Well, implementing the priority level was challenging. I spent
	some time trying to make it work. At the end I realized I mispelled
	"priotity".
3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
	a) I added the ability to delete several items at once
	b) I added the ability to change the priority of the to-do items
	I added these two items because I thing they are useful.
4. Where do you still have room to grow?
	Error handling. I do not find the error logs so helpful. In my
	opinion, they are not very precise and often point to the wrong
	place. Any tip to improve on this will be appreciated.
